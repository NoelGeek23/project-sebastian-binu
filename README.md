## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

There was a lot of research involoved while building this project. Tensorflow packages made this project a million times easier since CNN is an easy to use and understand neural network present in tensorflow framework. The hardest challenge however was integrating all three classifiers into one single classifer and optimize the effective models performance. 
This was made possible by openCV's online image identification platform. Moreover obtaining a good dataset was challenging since most commercial use datasets were paid and free once were either too large or too small for training and testing purposes.

Extracting google images was my first course of action but it turned out to be disaster since the performance of the overall model turned out to be close to one which is realistically not possible and model was greatly overfitting. This was due to the fact that google dataset only allowed training of a small batch and image filteration occurs whenever we google search.


This is a good resource on CNN by stanford on neural networks to gain insights on the topic :::: -----

## Roadmap

- Use CNN to train a deep learning model to predict GENDER

- Use CNN to train a deep learning model to predict AGE

- Use CNN to train a deep learning model to predict EMOTION

- Use functions in CV2 to detect faces within an image

- Combine the results and make a single face detection program.

## Screenshots

![](face%20detected.JPG?raw=true "Title")

Detection on my application is limited to five faces. Code can be tweaked to detect more faces at a time but this will increase the time complexity during training.
## Performance Metrics
